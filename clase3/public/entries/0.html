        &emsp;&emsp;This is the first sentence of this blog. I'll write about topics that I have interest on, to name a few: programming, computer science, gaming,
        cryptocurrencies (analisys, thoughts & code-reviews) and blockchain technologies. Some of them are related to my previous, actual and maybe future jobs (except gaming- I think).
      </p>

        &emsp;&emsp;It is not my goal to stay anonymous so I'll talk about myself in a few lines: my name is Matías Iribarren and I'm
        from Argentina. Currently, I'm studying to be an IT Engineer and working as a smart-contract's developer. My passions: computers,
        math, code and games (and beer). I love to re-think or re-design existing methodologies or ways to make things happen. 
      </p>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;Some details about my passions: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Coding: Java, JavaScript, TypeScript and Solidity are my favorites.</li>
        <li>Math: I really enjoy Algebra. Maybe in not-normal levels.</li>
        <li>Games: League of Legends, Pókemon and Argentum Online variations. PD: If you don't know any Argentum Online, you will if you read this blog</li>
        <li>Beers: Depends of the temperature but in general I like IPAs or Lagers.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        &emsp;&emsp;That is a short resume about me. Tomorrow, I'll write about some Solidity techniques that had been useful to me from time to time.
